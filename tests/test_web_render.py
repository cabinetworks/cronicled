    Two mutations matter enough to name explicitly:
      - the Undo button's `action` swapped from "/undo" to "/approve": the
        one control whose entire job is reversing a write would instead
        repeat it.

        Undo would then be offered on exactly the rows where
        `Stash.revert_scene` raises (no snapshot), and withheld on exactly
        the rows where it would work.

    The previous fixture here hardcoded `state="new"`/`prior_state=None`, so
    the Undo branch was never reached by any render -- these build both an
    undoable row and a non-undoable "applied" row through the same `_row`
    helper, via the same override path `test_web_rows.py` already relies on
    for `state`/`prior_state` (both live at the item's top level, unlike
